## Deliverable

* Excellent work! You hit almost every requirement spot on!
* A map is the correct choice for a program like this.
* Only thing missing was demonstration of dynamic memory allocation / deallocation and use of pointers, which admittedly does not fit well into a program like this.  Did not take off points given the well done design.

## Documentation

* Great work, would like to have had the UML diagram in your whitgit folder and displayed in the Readme.md file.
* Header documentation in .h and .cpp files could be better and more extensive.
* Overall an awesome job!

## Presentation

### Presentation Feedback

#### One things you really liked?

* Very good statistics for analyzing books.
* I really liked how she implemented the baby names lm into her project BUT put her own twist on it. Also, great use of maps instead of vectors.
* An interesting usage of the mapping library and functions
* This code is pretty useful, Can see myself using this. It's unique basically
* I liked how her use of finding the frequency of words can actually help determine the genre or the artist of a piece. The idea as a whole is pretty cool!
* Really good use of scanning data and information from documents to find certain data inside of them. I loved the use of maps over vectors and the commitment to understanding how maps would work.
* I liked how this was like the LM/class example we did earlier in the year but with more accessible code was to make it even bigger
* I really liked how you could search for a single word and its frequency across all the texts. Very useful! Also the speed of the program and the way you problem solved was great.
* The efficiency compared to our LMs was very impressive for this project.
* Thinking about efficiency and using maps instead of vector
* I liked that you could view the top words side by side
* The use of maps, the fast results and the overall demonstration.
* She used some codes that we did it on LM which is really good and also good presentation which is understandable.
* Really interesting idea, never would've thought of it. Good output


#### What is one thing you would change / modify / add to the project?

* I would like if the number of text in the output will be slowed down a little bit and reduce the the bulk of text so the user can read it nicely.
* There isn't much I would change to be honest. She really went above and beyond, and it seems like the program does exactly what she wanted it to do.
* My be add some more interesting formatting I don' t know how you would do that though
* Would have added more books
* The topic does seem a bit similar to our King James's Learning Module, but it was still cool nonetheless
* Nothing, this code works fast and flawlessly
* something I would change is the amount of stuff being able to print to screen, seems like there a lot to look at so I would change the format
* As we aren't able to see all the code in the 5 minute presentation, I'm not sure if this is already in the project, but you could find ways to compare the texts and output results about direct comparisons, rather than the results of each file next to each other.
* Ability to add a new text and get results for it would be nice.
* use polymorphism to calculate word occurrence in prose and poetry texts
* The ability to count how many times an individual character is used
* I cannot think of anything. Sorry!
* Nothing to add because the code is well-written and many activities do.
* Rather than just "top" words, maybe look for top key words. (Rather than "the" or "it"

#### General Feedback

* Very good. And nice implementation of using maps to analyze the file.
* Great Job!
* Good work!
* I love the time and commitment you put into this script, it shows good understanding of the functionality of the code and the User Interface display is incredible.
* Really well explained in the presentation.
